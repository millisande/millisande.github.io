# Millisande.github.io

This is the home page for all Millisande Bath authored content.

It is designed to just be a landing page for the other sites and therefore does not need to be complex or difficult to maintain.

It includes a Vue.js app shell in case it needs to be extended with dynamic text or further features.

Current included site links include:

[Millisande Bath Professional Portfolio](http://millisande.com)

[Puzzle game reviews](http://millisande.co.uk)
